# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Objective
This project aims to predict student academic performance (Pass/Fail) using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset
- Features include demographic, academic, and social attributes.
- Target variable: Final Grade (G3) converted into binary classification.

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Data preprocessing using Pandas
2. One-hot encoding for categorical features
3. Train-Test split (80-20)
4. Model training using:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
5. Model evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 92.4%
Decision Tree Accuracy: 84.81%

Logistic Regression showed better generalization performance on the dataset.

## 🧠 Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates how classical machine learning models can be applied to educational datasets for performance prediction.
